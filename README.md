# Immersive Dice Simulation Generator

## About this repo

This repository is currently very much a work in progress (WIP). It is meant as a showcase project for a software development portfolio.

It is planned to grow in size, scope and scale. It was therefore designed that way from the ground up using a **Behavior Driven Development** approach as well as **Domain Driven Design** and a **Clean Modular Monolith** architecture.

## Overview

The project goal is to enable a user to generate simulated playtest data to assist in the game development process of the ***Quantum Dawn: Neon Arena*** tabletop role-playing game which is also in an early development stage.

The latest rules available at https://immersive-gaming.itch.io/quantum-dawn-neon-arena-playtest-guide-printer-friendly serve as a specification which guides the development of the simulation generator.

Multiple user experiences are planned like GUIs and APIs.
